Congratulations!
I built a Rails app from scratch. What can I generalize so far?

Using the request/response cycle as a guide, this has been our workflow when making a Rails app: 

1. Generate a new Rails app.
2. Generate a controller and add an action.
3. Create a route that maps a URL to the controller action.
4. Create a view with HTML and CSS.
5. Run the local web server and preview the app in the browser.

Practice what I learned with two real-world projects:

1. Broadway
2. Bolt Network
